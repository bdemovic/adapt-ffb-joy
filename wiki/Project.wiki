= Project Plan and Status =

This page contains the project's plan and status. It lists what is still missing.

== What works ==

Now, an version of 3DP-Vert exist that works as a proof of concept for controlling force feedback on the Sidewinder FFP joystick. It can enable "FFB mode" on the joystick. It also allows starting a constant force effect (to left) and to stopping it by pressing joystick buttons. To free the UART TX-pin for sending the MIDI data to the joystick 3DP-Vert's button pins were moved to B0..B3 pins in the AVR.

== To Do ==

Things still to do.

=== USB HID Descriptor ==

A working USB HID descriptor with force feedback parts is needed. HID specs on physical devices is to be consulted (see USB.org's doc on HID PID).

There are a few example in web how to do this with a joystick-like HID. It is preferrable to have a HID descriptor that is based on the 3DPVert-project's Sidewinder ForceFeedback Pro, but that would add the FFB parts to it.

The descriptor should allow at least:
  * Constant, Sine and Triangle waveforms
  * Duration parameter
  * Direction parameter(s)
  * Periodic parameters (include frequency and amplitude, exclude Phase)
  * Ramp and envelope parameters for attack and fade

Note: AVR megas that do not have hardware USB (ie. ones that need to use the software USB) seem to have limitation on how large the HID descriptor can be and FFB seems to grow the descriptor size over those limits. However, Tweeny 2.0(++) has no such limit since they have hardware USB.

=== Converting USB data to MIDI ===

C-code for converting the FFB USB reports from PC must be converted to MIDI data.

The code should be as plain C as possible to be easily (or with no effort) be included to different projects on various hardware platforms. It also simplifies unit testing during development since the same code could be ran on a PC too.

=== Finalize the MIDI data analysis on effect parameters ===

Although many effect parameters have already been discovered from the MIDI data, a full description of all parameters and their data types is still missing.

=== Integrate with 3DPVert ===

Integrate with 3DPVert to have full blown game port FFB Sidewinder joystick to USB.
